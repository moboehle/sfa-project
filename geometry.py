#    geometry.py
#
#    Geometry functions to find intersecting lines.
#    Thes calc's use this formula for a straight line:-
#        y = mx + b where m is the gradient and b is the y value when x=0
#
#    See here for background http://www.mathopenref.com/coordintersection.html
#    
#    Throughout the code the variable p is a point tuple representing (x,y)
